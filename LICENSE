 * For the original file, see "wbgt.c.original" in the src directory of this
 * package. That file has been modified in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. The "main" function has been removed.
 * 2. All function declarations have been converted from K&R style to ANSI C99
 *    compliant style and moved to "wbgt.h".
 * 3. All floats have been converted to doubles to integrate more easily with R.
 * 4. Parameter documentation for functions is included in "wbgt.h"; these are
 *    copies of comments in "wbgt.c.original" accompanying the original K&R
 *    parameter declarations.
 * 5. For documentation in its original location, see "wbgt.c.original"
